CRITICAL DUST TRANSACTIONS FOUND:

Recent dust transactions (tiny amounts to the address):
- 0.00000546 BTC (546 satoshis) - Pattern repeated multiple times
- 0.00002000 BTC (2000 satoshis) - From 1GKRTErnthjsdXT9XbGTqKQQFYwbRbuGGd
- 0.00002526 BTC (2526 satoshis) - Multiple times  
- 0.00002380 BTC (2380 satoshis)
- 0.00001203 BTC (1203 satoshis)
- 0.00001126 BTC (1126 satoshis)
- 0.00001070 BTC (1070 satoshis)
- 0.00001000 BTC (1000 satoshis)
- 0.00000800 BTC (800 satoshis)
- 0.00000700 BTC (700 satoshis)

================================================================================
THE "DUST KEY" STRATEGY
================================================================================

The puzzle hint says:
"k2 might not be the L3... key you found, but rather the private key of 
a specific transaction that 'funded' the first address"

WHAT THIS MEANS:
1. Take k1 (from Cosmic Duality decryption - 149 bytes)
2. Convert k1 to Bitcoin address
3. Find the UTXO that SENT the dust to that address
4. The private key of THAT UTXO's input = k2

BLOCKCHAIN STRATEGY:
- Look at the INPUTS of the transactions that SENT dust to 1GSMG1JC...
- Find which address controlled those inputs before they were spent
- Get the private key of that funding address = k2

PROBLEM: We can see the RECEIVING addresses, but to get k2, we need:
- The INPUT transactions' private keys
- OR the puzzle must encode k2 directly somewhere else
- OR k2 is ALSO hidden in one of the dust amounts themselves (encoded)

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: The "Dust Amount" Itself Encodes Information
================================================================================

The AMOUNTS might encode k2:
- 546 satoshis (0x222 in hex) - "dust limit" standard
- 2000, 2526, 2380, 1203, 1126, 1070, 1000, 800, 700

Could these amounts, when converted to hex or combined, form k2?

Example:
- 546 = 0x222
- 2000 = 0x7D0  
- 2526 = 0x9DE
- etc.

Concatenating: 222 7D0 9DE ... could spell out k2?

================================================================================
CRITICAL MISSING INFORMATION
================================================================================

To get the ACTUAL k2 from blockchain, we need:
1. The TXID of the transaction that funded the dust-sending address
2. The INPUT INDEX that controlled that funding
3. Access to that input's key material

BUT if this is a puzzle, k2 is probably NOT actually on the blockchain
- It's either in the Cosmic Duality 149 bytes
- OR it's encoded in the dust amounts themselves
- OR it's in another puzzle file we haven't found yet

================================================================================
WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT
================================================================================

1. Decode what the 149-byte Cosmic Duality actually contains
   - Is it two complete keys?
   - Or one key + encoding instructions?
   - Or something else entirely?

2. Check if the dust AMOUNTS encode information
   - Do they form a pattern?
   - Can they be converted to a hex key?

3. Try all combinations of the password options with different interpretations
   of the 149 bytes to extract meaningful k1 and k2
