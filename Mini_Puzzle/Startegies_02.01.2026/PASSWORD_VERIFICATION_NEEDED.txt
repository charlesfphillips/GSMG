STATUS: We have successfully extracted and decoded:
  ✓ Salphaseion content from HTML
  ✓ Cosmic Duality encrypted blob
  ✓ ABBA binary sections: "matrixsumlist" and "enter"
  ✓ Verified file integrity

CURRENT ISSUE:
  The password "matrixsumlist" does NOT decrypt Cosmic Duality
  Error: "bad decrypt" from OpenSSL

TESTED PASSWORDS (ALL FAILED):
  ✗ matrixsumlist
  ✗ matrixsumlist (SHA256 hash)
  ✗ enter
  ✗ matrixsumlistenter
  ✗ matrixsumlist enter
  ✗ and 50+ other variations

COSMIC DUALITY FILE:
  Size: 1819 bytes (base64 encoded)
  Starts with: U2FsdGVkX18tP2/gbclQ5tNZuD4shoV3axuUd8J8aycGCAMoYfhZK0JecHTDpTFe
  Ends with: kJXDRjD6yvhNfQMCSkm6l9zMWxKvFbv5g2ae2SLrEt/x3MP2/G
  Extracted from: Official HTML document

QUESTION FOR YOU:
  1. Is "matrixsumlist" the EXACT correct password?
  2. Should it have any special formatting?
  3. Is the password possibly hidden in the hex sections we couldn't decode?
  4. Or does the password come from the substitution cipher in Part 0?

NEXT STEP:
  Once we confirm the correct password, we can immediately decrypt and find the private key!
