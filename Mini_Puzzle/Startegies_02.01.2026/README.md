## ✨ Key Insights

1. **The puzzle is layered** - Each phase's output feeds into the next
2. **Documentation is key** - Reading the guides saves more time than trial-and-error
3. **Passwords are combined** - Final password likely concatenates multiple decoded sections
4. **Hashing is involved** - SHA256 appears multiple times in the chain
5. **Tools matter** - Use OpenSSL and online decoders rather than implementing yourself
